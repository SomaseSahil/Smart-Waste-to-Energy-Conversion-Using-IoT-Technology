## üìú Project Overview  
This project focuses on converting all types of waste (household, industrial, medical, e-waste, etc.) into green energy using a fully automated waste processing plant. The key steps include:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Waste Collection: Collecting all types of waste and transporting it to a central processing plant.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Waste Separation: Using AI-powered sorting to separate recyclable and non-recyclable waste.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Biogas Production: Converting organic waste into methane gas for household and industrial use.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Electricity Generation: Using dried residual waste to generate electricity via waste-to-energy technology.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Pollution Control: Using filters and scrubbers to reduce emissions from waste burning.
6Ô∏è‚É£ IoT-Based Monitoring: Real-time tracking of waste processing, gas production, and energy generation through a web-based dashboard.

This project promotes sustainable waste management, renewable energy generation, and environmental conservation, aligning with UN SDG goals (7, 11, 13).
